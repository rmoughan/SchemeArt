# SchemeArt
A recursive painting using the Scheme dialect of LISP that won 2nd place in the Berkeley CS competition

Included is a scheme interpreter that is written in Python (if you want just that, it's all the .py files that aren't the LISCENSE and README). The code for the actual artwork is in the contest.scm file.
